## I am a graphic designer and pun enthusiast!

Iâ€™m currently studying a Bachelor of Creative Arts (Graphic Design) and a Bachelor of Communication and Media Studies (Marketing Communication and Advertising) at the University of Wollongong.

I enjoy challenging design problems and getting creative as much as possible.
