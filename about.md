<!-- ## I am a graphic designer and pun enthusiast! -->

Hi, I’m Kate.

I have a passion for communicating fun, quirky and innovative solutions to challenges in simple yet memorable ways.

In 2018 I graduated from the University of Wollongong a Bachelor of Creative Arts and Bachelor of Communication and Media studies majoring in Graphic Design and Marketing Communications and Advertising.

I’m a huge advocate for learning and am always looking to expand my creative and technical skills. In in my spare time you can find me learning to code, sewing, cross-stitching and photographing.
